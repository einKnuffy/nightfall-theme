# Nightfall Theme

By developers (just me), for developers

*The one and only* theme for Visual Studio Code

---

### Inspiration

Inspired by many other themes, but especially from *JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA*'s Nightfall theme.

Huge thanks to the creators of that theme, I really enjoyed using it. <3

### Contribution

Feel free to think about and create changes.

This is Open-Source, *baby*.
